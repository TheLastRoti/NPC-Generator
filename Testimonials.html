    every single new combination is completely unique, I'm sure to have some great interactions in my campaign now! Thank you Amrit,
    you've made the D&D community whole again." <br> <br> - Bhai Anantvir Singh

    <br> <br> <br> "I found this and tried out the first randomly generated character I created. They were more captivating and
    real than anything I could have created myself, I was completely blown away! This will surely save me countless hours planning 
    sessions!" <br> <br> - Rey Skywalker

    <br> <br> <br> "Forget the generator, take a look at how well-designed this website is! Everything looks perfect and the unique images really
    add something to the website. It really makes you want to design a character using this app. Other NPC Generators aren't nearly as streamlined
    as this one, that's for sure" <br> <br> - Barack Obama
