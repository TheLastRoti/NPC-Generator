    <br> <h2> Welcome to Lev's NPC Generator! While originally a simple project for a class, this website turned into something so much more, and something
    I'm proud to call my own (with some help from Mr. Powell, of course). <br> <br> <br>
    I started this project with a simple goal in mind: To create a small generator to use for my limited D&D campaigns. As I began to work on the 
    generator, I realized what I could potentially turn this Web App into, and so I began work on a very intricate project. <br> <br> <br>
    I began to spend countless hours creating hundreds of unique keywords. In total, I ended with 1170 keywords with over 50 containers! This results in
    in a number of combinations too big to write in this small section. I also heavily experimented with CSS to bring you this colourful and
    tidy website, brought to you by a few helpful people over on StackOverflow.com. <br> <br> <br> 
    I did this because I really wanted to create something people could use and benefit from. Not just a few keywords to get me a mark on a 
    school project, but a real tool. I feel my hard work paid off, because every time you click that awesome button, a completely new character is generated
    that is completely different from the next. I accomplished my goal! :) </h2>
